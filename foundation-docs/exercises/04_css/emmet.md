Now you've (hopefully) learned how to write proper/valid HTML codes, it's the time to do some tricks.

[Emmet](http://emmet.io) is a plugin for text editors etc that saves your time from typing full HTML/CSS tags. Emmet is enabled by default in C9 through the Plugin Manager.

In C9 start a new workspace and name it lab5. Open the auto-generated hello-world.html file and remove all contents. Type in the exclamation mark and immediately hit the tab key. What happened?

What you see is that the editor expands the single character into a full HTML template. Behind the scene, it's Emmet that does the job.

There are quite a few other tricks you can do as well, for example:

* Type `table1` and hit tab immediately, it will expand into full table element.

* Type `ul>li*8` and hit tab immediately, it will expand into full list element.
